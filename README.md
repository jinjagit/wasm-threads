# wasm-threads

Proof of concept exercise. Running 2 threads concurrently in WASM (compiled from Rust).  

## Setup

Based on clone of https://github.com/sn99/wasm-template-rust, modified similarly to https://github.com/jinjagit/wasm-2d (but with changes specific to this repo).  
  
Note: this process uses Travis CI to deploy to GitHub Pages.
